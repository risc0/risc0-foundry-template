# zkVM Methods

This directory contains the [zkVM] portion of your [RISC Zero] application.
This is where you will define one or more [guest programs] to act as a coprocessor to your [on-chain logic].

> In typical use cases, the only code in this directory that you will need to edit is inside [guest/src/bin].

## Writing Guest Code

To learn to write code for the zkVM, we recommend the [Hello World tutorial][zkvm-hello-world].

Examples of what you can do in the guest can be found in the [RISC Zero examples].

## From Guest Code to Binary File

Code in the `methods/guest` directory will be compiled into one or more binaries.

Build configuration for the methods is included in `methods/build.rs`.

Each will have a corresponding image ID, which is a hash identifying the program.
