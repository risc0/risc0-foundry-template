# RISC Zero Foundry Template

Starter template for writing an application using [RISC Zero] and Ethereum.

This repository implements an application on Ethereum utilizing RISC Zero as a [coprocessor] to the smart contract application.
It provides a starting point for building powerful new applications on Ethereum that offload computationally intensive (i.e. gas expensive), or would be difficult to implement Solidity (e.g. ed25519 signature verification, or HTML parsing).

Prove computation with the [RISC Zero zkVM] and verify the results in your Ethereum contract.

## Overview

Here is a simplified overview of how devs can integrate RISC Zero, with [Bonsai] proving, into their Ethereum smart contracts:

![RISC Zero Foundry Template Diagram](images/risc0-foundry-template.png)

1. Run your application logic in the [RISC Zero zkVM]. The provided [publisher] app sends an off-chain proof request to the [Bonsai] proving service.
2. [Bonsai] generates the program result, written to the [journal], and a SNARK proof of its correctness.
3. The [publisher] app submits this proof and journal on-chain to your app contract for validation.
4. Your app contract calls the [RISC Zero Verifier] to validate the proof. If the verification is successful, the journal is deemed trustworthy and can be safely used.

## Dependencies

First, [install Rust] and [Foundry], and then restart your terminal.

```sh
# Install Rust
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
# Install Foundry
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Next, you will need to install the `cargo risczero` tool.
We'll use [`cargo binstall`][cargo-binstall] to get `cargo-risczero` installed, and then install the `risc0` toolchain.
See [RISC Zero installation] for more details.

```sh
cargo install cargo-binstall
cargo binstall cargo-risczero
cargo risczero install
```

Now you have all the tools you need to develop and deploy an application with [RISC Zero].

## Quick Start

First, install the RISC Zero toolchain using the [instructions above](#dependencies).

Now, you can initialize a new RISC Zero project at a location of your choosing:

```sh
forge init -t risc0/bonsai-foundry-template ./my-project
```

Congratulations! You've just started your first RISC Zero project.

Your new project consists of:

- a [zkVM program] (written in Rust), which specifies a computation that will be proven;
- a [app contract] (written in Solidity), which uses the proven results;
- a [publisher] which makes proving requests to [Bonsai] and posts the proof to Ethereum.
  We provide an example implementation, but your dApp interface or application servers could act as the publisher.

### Build the Code

- Builds for zkVM program, the publisher app, and any other Rust code.

  ```sh
  cargo build
  ```

- Build your Solidity smart contracts

  > NOTE: `cargo build` needs to run first to generate the `ImageID.sol` contract.

  ```sh
  forge build
  ```

### Run the Tests

- Tests your zkVM program.

  ```sh
  cargo test
  ```

- Test your Solidity contracts, integrated with your zkVM program.

  ```sh
  RISC0_DEV_MODE=true forge test -vvv 
  ```

## Develop Your Application

To build your application, you'll need to make changes in three folders:

- write the code you want proven in the [methods/guest](./methods/guest/) folder.
- write the on-chain part of your project in the [contracts](./contracts/) folder.
- adjust the publisher example in the [apps](./apps/) folder.

### Configuring Bonsai

***Note:*** *To request an API key [complete the form here](https://bonsai.xyz/apply).*

With the Bonsai proving service, you can produce a [Groth16 SNARK proof] that is verifiable on-chain.
You can get started by setting the following environment variables with your API key and associated URL.

```bash
export BONSAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY" # see form linked above
export BONSAI_API_URL="BONSAI_URL" # provided with your api key
```

Now if you run `forge test` with `RISC0_DEV_MODE=false`, the test will run as before, but will additionally use the fully verifying `RiscZeroGroth16Verifier` contract instead of `MockRiscZeroVerifier` and will request a SNARK receipt from Bonsai.

```bash
RISC0_DEV_MODE=false forge test -vvv
```

### Deterministic Builds

By setting the environment variable `RISC0_USE_DOCKER` a containerized build process via Docker will ensure that all builds of your guest code, regardless of the machine or local environment, will produce the same [image ID][image-id].
The [image ID][image-id], and its importance to security, is explained in more detail in our [developer FAQ].

```bash
RISC0_USE_DOCKER=1 cargo build
```

> ***Note:*** *This requires having Docker installed and in your PATH. To install Docker see [Get Docker].*

## Deploy Your Application

When you're ready, follow the [deployment guide] to get your application running on [Sepolia].
